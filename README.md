# Abstract

Despite skin microbiome has been linked to skin health and diseases, its role in modulating human skin appearance remains understudied. Although a few studies have identified the microbial correlations with specific skin appearance features, the majority of them remained underexplored due to the lack of the large-scale cohorts with comprehensive omics data. Using a total of 1,244 face phenomes and 246 cheek metagenomes, we found that besides aging and gender as intrinsic factors, skin microbiome also played a role in shaping skin imaging phenotypes (SIPs). Skin taxonomic and functional Î± diversity was positively linked to melanin, pore, spot, and ultraviolet spot levels, but negatively linked to sebum, lightening, and porphyrins levels. Moreover, age and SIPs could collectively explain 7.48% and 12.59% of the individual heterogeneity in taxonomic and functional composition, respectively. Furthermore, certain species were correlated with specific SIPs, such as sebum and lightening levels negatively correlated with *Corynebacterium matruchotii*, *Staphylococcus capitis*, and *Streptococcus sanguinis*. Notably, most of SIPs could be effectively predicted by skin species abundances, among which the lightening level presented the least error of 1.8%. Lastly, we provided a reservoir of potential mechanisms through which skin microbiome adjusted the SIPs, including the modulation of pore, wrinkle, and sebum levels by cobalamin and heme synthesis pathways, predominantly driven by *Cutibacterium acnes*. This pioneering study unveils the paradigm for the hidden links between skin microbiome and skin imaging phenome, providing novel insights into how skin microbiome shapes skin appearance and its healthy aging.
